# Banking-App

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The initial focus of this project is on investing and compound interest. This program allows users to see how their investments will grow over time. The screen displays the following informations: 

• Initial Investment Amount: The starting amount of your investment (a positive real
number)<br>
• Monthly Deposit: The amount you plan to contribute to the growth of your investment
each month (a positive real number)<br>
• Annual Interest (Compounded): Interest that is added to the principal sum of your
investment and its previously accumulated interest (interest on interest and principal)<br>
• Number of Years: The number of years your investment has to grow <br>
• A way to see the data (for example: “Press enter to continue…”) <br>
